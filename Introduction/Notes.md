# Classes and Objects

Classes are basically user defined blueprint of data structures , whereas objects are <br> instances of classes. <br>

## `Basic Structure of a class :`

```cpp
class Class_name{
    string name ;
    int price ;
    string model ;
    string chassis_no;
    //these are all known as attributes of a class.
}
```
>Note : If we create multiple object accesing all of them separately is a repititive task.

## `Printing values using a function`
