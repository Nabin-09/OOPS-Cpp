# Classes and Objects

Classes are basically user defined blueprint of data structures , whereas objects are <br> instances of classes. <br>

## `Basic Structure of a class :`

```cpp
class Class_name{
    string name ;
    int price ;
    string model ;
    string chassis_no;
    //these are all known as attributes of a class.
}
```
>Note : If we create multiple object accesing all of them separately is a repititive task.

## `Printing values using a function` 

**Refer to Code2.cpp for the topic :** [Code2.cpp](https://github.com/Nabin-09/OOPS-Cpp/blob/main/Introduction/Code2.cpp)

>Note : By default we do Pass by reference in case of objects too , so if we want <br> to change we have to send it by reference

# `Constructors : `

A constructor is a function who name is same as the class and has no return type , it is <br> automatically called when an object of class is created.
